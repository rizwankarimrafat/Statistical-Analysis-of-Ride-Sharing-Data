# Statistical Analysis of Ride Sharing Data

This project focuses on the statistical analysis of ride-sharing data, aiming to uncover patterns and relationships within the dataset. By examining various factors such as passenger ratings, driver characteristics, and ride details, the project seeks to provide insights into how these elements interact and influence one another.

## Key Analyses Performed

1. **Association Between Passenger Rating and Gender on Weekends:** We investigated whether there's a significant association between a passenger's rating and their gender for rides taken on weekends. Using chi-squared tests and simulations, we found no significant association, indicating that gender does not play a notable role in determining passenger ratings during weekends.

2. **Comparison of Tips Between Male and Female Drivers:** This analysis focused on whether male drivers received higher tips than female drivers on Thursdays. Through hypothesis testing and data simulations, it was observed that there is no significant difference, with female drivers, in fact, showing a higher mean tip, although not statistically significant.

3. **Fare Differences Based on Pickup Locations:** We compared fares charged for rides starting from Olympic Park versus Circular Quay. Using bootstrapping and t-distribution methods, we established a 98% confidence interval for the difference in mean fares, providing insights into fare variations based on starting locations.

4. **Day-of-Week Impact on Fare:** This section tests whether the day of the week affects the fare charged for rides. The analysis revealed that Sunday had the highest mean fare, with significant differences observed across different days of the week.

5. **Relationship Between Fare and Tip:** Finally, we explored the relationship between the fare charged and the tip provided for morning rides. The analysis showed no significant linear relationship, indicating that fare is not a good predictor of the tip amount in this context.

## Conclusion

The project provides a comprehensive statistical analysis of various factors affecting ride-sharing experiences. By using different statistical techniques, including hypothesis testing, bootstrapping, and regression analysis, this project sheds light on the dynamics of passenger ratings, tipping behavior, and fare determination.
